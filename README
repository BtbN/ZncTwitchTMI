ZNC Module for Twitch IRC Chat interface

If the presence of this module makes your ZNC behave weird or even makes it crash,
you might have to use a diffrent SSL backend for libcurl, as the default openssl
based one conflicts with znc itself using openssl.
On Debian-Based distributions, just install for example libcurl3-nss


Whispers:

To use whispers, add one of Twitchs group chat servers as a seperate network to ZNC
and load the twitch_group module on that Network.
Whispers will be forwarded between the main Twitch network(The one where the twitch
module is loaded) and the group chat network(The one with twitch_group loaded).
