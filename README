ZNC Module for Twitch IRC Chat interface

If the presence of this module makes your ZNC behave weird or even makes it crash,
you might have to use a diffrent SSL backend for libcurl, as the default openssl
based one conflicts with znc itself using openssl.
On Debian-Based distributions, just install for example libcurl3-nss
